2.0,PROD,"There was far too much unstructured time and “fluff” in this program. We were often left on our own to “work on a project,” which felt unrealistic given that we were expected to learn new tools and implement a solution by the end of day three.  After the first day, there was minimal hands‑on use of the technology. Most of the remaining time focused on abstract discussions about “being human” or other theoretical ideas rather than practical skill‑building. Additionally, the tracks were not well‑defined—participants who fell between the Developer and Productivity paths had no clear way to succeed in either.  Overall, the structure made it difficult to gain meaningful experience with the tools or achieve the intended outcomes.",Learning new tools and uses,"I think the experience would be greatly improved with more intentional structure and actionable content. Consider creating tracks that align with participant goals and backgrounds—such as entrepreneurs, educators, and tech/computer specialists—so attendees can dive into material that is actually relevant to how they plan to use the tools.  The sessions should focus more on action: walking us step‑by‑step through how to use each tool, set up programs correctly, and maximize their inner workings. Demonstrating these processes in detail would make the learning tangible and applicable.  Soft‑skill and “human” conversations are valuable but should be limited to one dedicated session, rather than spread throughout. Much of the time felt dominated by buzzwords and abstract, “impactful‑sounding” discussions without concrete takeaways. A shift toward hands‑on, practical instruction would make the program far more effective.",1690
4.0,PROD,"Logistics, planning,  administration of event",A bit across all parts.,"Ok, firstly wow.  I ended up learning o much with practical application and use. WOW..just blown away by ""some"" of the sessions.  Secondly your survey is lackluster and poor. Lastly.. the overall experience was a 1 from 1-10. The logistics, administrative, planning of event were the worst ever experienced. From no coordination and timing on checkin and opening events.. to not having enough food. Folks paid $400 dollars and the received at beat $75 dollars in value. I say this from iver 30yrs odlf event and rest. experience",598
6.0,DEV,"More organization. Itineraries for all three days, breakfast and lunch provided, sticking to schedule. For developers, have them create their accounts and keys a week before the event with visual instructions.",Learning how to properly use an LLM and its limitations.,nan,270
