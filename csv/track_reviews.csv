PROD,1,2.0,733,"There was far too much unstructured time and “fluff” in this program. We were often left on our own to “work on a project,” which felt unrealistic given that we were expected to learn new tools and implement a solution by the end of day three.  After the first day, there was minimal hands‑on use of the technology. Most of the remaining time focused on abstract discussions about “being human” or other theoretical ideas rather than practical skill‑building. Additionally, the tracks were not well‑defined—participants who fell between the Developer and Productivity paths had no clear way to succeed in either.  Overall, the structure made it difficult to gain meaningful experience with the tools or achieve the intended outcomes."
DEV,1,6.0,209,"More organization. Itineraries for all three days, breakfast and lunch provided, sticking to schedule. For developers, have them create their accounts and keys a week before the event with visual instructions."
